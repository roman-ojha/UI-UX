*) The Image Gallery:
    -> An image gallery is a way of displaying a collection of images while allowing users to see several items at once.
    -> Image galleries are heavily used in online stores to show product variations or angles.
    -> Galleries can also be lined to a slideshow that will display larger version of the images.
    -> EX:
        -> https://www.adidas.com/us/men-sale
        -> https://grovemade.com/desk-pad-collection/
        -> https://p9.moscow/en/
