*) Spacing and Sizing in Web design:
    -> This refer to how much space you should use inside and outside of the elements and how much they big or small needs to be.
    -> For both spacing and sizing we can use like 8 point system:
        -> In this system every dimension is actually the multiple of 8.
        -> Ex: For Button we can use padding of 16px top & button and 32px of left & right.
        -> We can use this system every where like margin & padding of the system, distance between elements, widths & height of elements or images.
