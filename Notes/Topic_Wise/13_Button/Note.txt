*) The Button:
    -> In UI Design, a button is a fundamental interactive element that serves as a middleman between the user and the product or service
    -> Buttons are not used solely for navigation - They can perform various actions like toggling an element's visibility, performing a task in the backend etc.
    -> Button on the same website/webpage could be of different style with different color etc...
