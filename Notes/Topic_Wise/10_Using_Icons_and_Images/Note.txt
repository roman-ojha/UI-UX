*) Icons:
    -> Icon should be meaningful, it means that Icons should what the associated text says.
        -> EX: './01_Button_with_Icon.png' Button which says 'Send Message' but Icons is not matching with the meaning of the text
        -> But './02_Button_with_Icon.png' matching the icon with the meaning of button
    -> You need to be consistent on adding same style of icons on the web page.
        -> EX: './03_Icons.png' message icon is not matching with the outline of other icons
        -> But './04_Icons.png' here it looks nice and consistent.
        
*) Images:
    -> Try to use the meaningful images that matches the actual theme of the website.
    -> Use stock photos sparingly and avoid the cheesy, over-used, clichee ones.
    -> Whenever possible, use photos that are provided by the client. Keep it real.
