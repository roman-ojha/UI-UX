    -> The group of colors that can work together.
    -> When starting a design process, it's always easier to begin with the colors.
    -> Create a palette for primary and secondary colors first, then move on the gray.
    -> When creating a grays, mix in a bit of the primary color.

    -> Make cure that every color you're using for text or interactive element has enough contrast.
